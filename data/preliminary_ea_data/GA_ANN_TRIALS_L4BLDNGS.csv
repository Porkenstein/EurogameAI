Gave impressive results, as a population finally seemed to develop a pattern which made use of the Level 4 buildings.  One amusing note is that while monitoring which Level four buildings were chosen, the commonality in the later generations was the Customs House, which essentially gives free points equal to 25% of your current point value.  This behavior combined with the fact that the games played were shorter than average made ail4 the most promising file yet.",ail4

The idea here was to keep as many promising weightsets as possible while constantly changing the bred population.  This will likely prevent the kept ranks from moving into less fit states, while ensuring that the population is not stuck at a local maximum. In this trial, however, strategies acheiving high scores were not attained.",ail5
